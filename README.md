Key Changes:
Check for Unfollow/Unlike: After clicking the "Manage" button, the script checks if the "Unfollow" or "Unlike" button exists. If neither exists, it skips to the next item.

Logging Skipped Items: If neither button is found, the script logs a message to the console, indicating that the item was skipped.

How to Use:
Navigate to the Facebook Page: Go to the page where you want to unfollow/unlike items (e.g., the "Following" section).

Open the Developer Console:

Right-click anywhere on the page and select "Inspect".
Go to the "Console" tab.
Paste the Script into the console and press Enter.

Monitoring:
The script logs each unfollow/unlike action or skip to the console so you can monitor its progress.
It continues automatically, processing all items in the list.
